When it is necessary to manipulate the size of PDF files,   
various Linux software solutions can be used,   
but some are difficult for users.    
Here I try to make working with PDF files a little easier.

To change the size of an image with GIMP, click on the Image item in the top menu.  
Then I select Image Scale.   
At this point I modify the values in the width and height fields of the photo.   
They are measured in pixels.
